# XHangouts
Google Hangouts is a great SMS app for those of us who also make considerable use of the Google
Hangouts IM platform. While it does a better job of handling MMS than most Android
alternatives it still has a few key persisting issues:

* Images not being properly rotated
* Low quality resizing making text impossible to read
* *TODO:* Horrific MMS wake locking. If the MMS transaction process doesn't go *perfectly* you can kiss your battery goodbye. Hangouts will send an MMS or literally die trying.

XHangouts is an Xposed module tasked with resolving these issues. Maybe one day we'll get a seamless iMessage-esque solution from Google...
